## Installation

To run this project, follow the following steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm start`.

## Styling approach

I've used the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention for CSS classes. BEM helps maintain a modular and consistent styling approach, making it easier to manage styles across different components.

Global styles are defined using CSS and are imported into index.css. These global styles ensure consistent styling for elements across the page.
